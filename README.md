Steampunk IRC is a simple web-based IRC client. A user's browser
connects to a server which maintains a persistent connection to an
IRC server (similar to bouncers like [ZNC][]) and relays messages
between the browser and the IRC server.

The name *Steampunk* was chosen because my friend [Pascal Finette][finette]
once jokingly referred to IRC as [steampunk][], which I found both
humorous and apt.
